# 42-ft_printf

Are you tired of using alternatively ft_putstr and ft_putnbr for your displays? You donâ€™t have the right to use printf? Re-code your own! This is a good time to discover a C feature: variadic functions, and to train your display options management skills. You will then be able to use your printf in all future projects.

# Compiling and running
Run the command `make` at the root of the repo then you can't run the program in solo.
You just have a libft_printf.a (it's an additionnal library).
